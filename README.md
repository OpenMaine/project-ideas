## About the OpenMaine Team

OpenMaine uses civic technology to improve quality of life. We want to help citizen, government, and nonprofit stakeholders solve problems.

OpenMaine is an [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source) organization. We make our projects freely and openly available. GitHub is where we collaborate. There are some really handy tools here, including a feature called [*Issues*](#). This is where we can break projects into manageable problems for collaborators to solve together. 

We hope you find what you're looking for, but if you need help, you can email us at em@openmaine.org!


## How To Propose or Discuss Project Ideas

[GitHub Issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) work just like any other commenting system on the Internet. 

### First, you'll need to [create an account](https://github.com/join). 

### Then you have two options: 

#### Comment on an existing idea (a.k.a. "issue")

Scroll through the [issues list](https://github.com/openmaine/project-ideas/issues) first to see if anyone's already thinking the same way! If you see an idea that catches your eye, click on it, read the discussion, and then add your thoughts to the bottom of the discussion thread. If you see the **Needs Leadership** label, bring it up at a hack night, and if you're up for it you can take the lead on it!

#### Or, create a new idea.

If you don't see the idea you have in mind, [add a new one](https://github.com/openmaine/project-ideas/issues/new). You'll need a title and description. Someone from the OpenMaine Leadership Team will respond, likely with some questions or feedback, and assign you to the issue to indicate you are leading the effort.

*Here's a [quick video intro](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlrJVSJRUN4) on using Github Issues for discussion.*

### Next Steps

* Please make a status update to your issues at least once a month to keep others informed. If we don't hear from you after some time, we might assume you've moved on and will ask others to take the lead.

* If nobody's talking yet, it might be that your idea needs some more fleshing out. We highly recommend thinking through the [Civic Tech Canvas](https://github.com/open-austin/civic-tech-canvas) as a next step! 

* If you're willing to be the champion on this project, you should let one of our [project leads](mailto:#) know. GitHub is the platform we're using to collect and vet ideas and then convert them into [active projects](#). Once a project becomes active, we'll help you set up a repository on the OpenMaine GitHub organization so you can start scoping and collaborating. We'll continue to use the Issues feature on your own project repo to flag obstacles, opportunities, and answer questions about that specific project. We will then add the project repo link to your idea issue and close it, indicating your graduation from idea to an active project.
